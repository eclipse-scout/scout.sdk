BSI CRM ticket: 107'357
Problem:
The name of the JAR file generated by the Scout SDK should be based on the WSDL instead of the alias.
This would solve the problem where the provider and the consumer are both part of the application and
there are thus two seperate JAR files containing the same class (with the same package name).
Solution:
- The name of the stub JAR file is not derived from the alias anymore but from the WSDL filename instead.
  This behavior can be overwritten by adding the build property 'jar' with the respective stub JAR file name.
- Phantom stub JAR files can be discovered and removed in Scout SDK on the root node 'Web Services (JAX-WS)'. There you find the link 'Cleanup phantom stub JAR files' on the property page.
Migration:
- rebuild the WS stubs of all providers and consumers
- Remove phantom stub JAR files as described in solution.
